# SevenKewp

This will probably be abandoned in a few months and never touched again. I just want to learn how to make a mod, mostly.

Forked from: [halflife-updated](https://github.com/Solokiller/halflife-updated)

# Building the source
### Windows users:
1. Install CMake and Visual Studio
1. Download and extract the source somewhere
1. Open a command prompt in the `SevenKewp` folder and run these commands:
    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -A Win32
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
